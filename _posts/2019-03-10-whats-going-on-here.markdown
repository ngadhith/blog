Im not really sure. To be completely honest I have no idea what I am doing with this website. It started out as an experiment with the Jekyll static site generator but now I have decided to use this as my blogging platform. The content that I am planning to upload here will primarily concern three things:

- Coding 🖥

- World News 📰

- Video Games 🎮

 You can expect a blog post once every week or so. Jekyll allows me to easily generate static site content using markdown so I can focus on the content of my posts rather than the code that surrounds it.
